 *
 * Sign-up is where the address is normally captured, so the endpoint exists for
 * the two cases sign-up can't cover: an account that predates the address being
 * part of registration, and a business that has since moved. It never sets the
 * trip's origin per-order — `POST /api/trips` still reads the stored row.
 *
 * The trading name is accepted alongside because it lives on this row and the
 * account name lives on `users` — the profile page changes both, and letting
 * them drift means a business whose maps label disagrees with its own header.
