/**
 * A courier lets go of a job they had accepted, before reaching the pickup.
 *
 * Deliberately not a cancellation of the delivery. The business still wants
 * their parcel moved — they didn't change their mind, a rider did — so the
 * request goes back out to everyone else rather than dying with the one person
 * who dropped it. What changes is only this courier's relationship to it:
 *
 *   - the trip returns to `requested` and loses its assignment;
 *   - the dispatch clock restarts, so the ring begins again from the tightest
 *     radius rather than resuming wherever the original search had spread to;
 *   - a decline is written, so the ring never offers it back to the rider who
 *     just let it go.
 *
 * `accepted_at` is deliberately left in place. It is what tells the business's
 * tracking screen that this search follows a rider dropping out rather than
 * being the original one — see `releasedByCourier` in `GET /api/trips` — and
 * the next acceptance overwrites it.
 *
 * The window closes on arrival: from `courier_arriving` the rider is at the
 * counter, and walking away from that is not something to do through an API.
