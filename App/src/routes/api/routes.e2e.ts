/**
 * The route surface itself.
 *
 * These assert only that each endpoint *exists with the method it is called
 * with*, which sounds too trivial to test until it isn't: `GET /api/trips` was
 * silently deleted by a bad refactor and shipped to production, because a
 * missing export is neither a type error nor a build error and nothing else
 * looked. The business tracking screen polls that endpoint every four seconds
 * and simply stopped working.
 *
 * The signal is the status code. `405` means SvelteKit matched the route but
 * found no handler for the method — the exact shape of that regression. `401`
 * means the handler is there and did its job on a signed-out caller, which is
 * all these need to prove; what the endpoints actually *do* is covered by
 * signing in, which these deliberately don't, so they stay fast and need no
 * fixtures.
