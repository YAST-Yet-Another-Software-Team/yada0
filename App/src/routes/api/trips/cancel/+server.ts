/**
 * Withdraw a delivery request.
 *
 * The window closes when the rider reaches the counter, not when they accept.
 * Until then a business that changes its mind — the customer rang back, the
 * kitchen ran out — is calling off a journey, and the rider learns of it the
 * next time their screen refreshes. From `courier_arriving` on, someone is
 * standing at the shop for this, and the way out of that is a conversation, not
 * a button.
 *
 * The rule is enforced here and not only in the UI, because the dashboard, the
 * tracking screen and anything later that wants a cancel button all reach this
 * same endpoint.
