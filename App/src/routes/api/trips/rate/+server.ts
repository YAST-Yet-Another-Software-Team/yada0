 * the only thing that differs is who the counterpart is. Two endpoints would be
 * two copies of that list, and the copies would drift.
 *
 * Who may rate whom falls straight out of the trip row: the business rates the
 * rider who carried it, the rider rates the business they carried for, and
 * anyone who is neither gets the same 404 a nonexistent trip gets, so a stranger
 * probing ids cannot tell them apart.
 *
 * "Once" is enforced by the table's unique constraint rather than a
 * read-then-write, so two racing submissions can't both land. Note the
 * constraint is on (trip_id, rater_id), not on the trip — the two directions are
 * independent, and each side rating the same delivery is two rows, not a
 * conflict. The rated party's cached average updates in the same transaction.
