 * Adding a parameter here would turn it into an administrative endpoint, which
 * YADA has no concept of and no role to guard with.
 *
 * Role-agnostic, because closing an account is not a workspace action — both a
 * business and a courier reach it from their own settings screen through the
 * same shared card.
 *
 * The email is typed back rather than a password re-entered: Google accounts
 * have no password, and a gate that only works for half the users is a gate
 * that has to be worked around. Typing the address proves the person knows
 * *which* account they are closing, which is the mistake actually worth
 * catching — a shared phone with the wrong session open.
