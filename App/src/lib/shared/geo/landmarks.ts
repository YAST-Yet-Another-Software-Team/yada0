/**
 * Known places in the KNUST / Ayeduase service area.
 *
 * A pin has to be shown to somebody as a name — "Unity Hall, KNUST", not
 * "6.67980, -1.57320". Coordinates on screen are a leak of the implementation:
 * nobody dispatches to six decimal places, and a courier reading one learns
 * nothing they can act on.
 *
 * Reverse geocoding answers that, at a price per call. This table answers it
 * first, for free, for the handful of places most deliveries around campus
 * actually go to — and it answers *better*, because these are the names people
 * here use. Google will happily return a Plus Code ("GJ8H+3M Kumasi") for a spot
 * it has no street address for, which is coordinates wearing a hat.
 *
 * It is meant to grow. Every entry added is a class of lookup that stops
 * costing anything, so adding the halls, gates and hostels a business actually
 * delivers to is the cheapest optimisation available here. Coordinates should be
 * read off the map rather than guessed: a landmark in the wrong place misnames
 * every pin near it.

 * Three dozen hand-picked points is an insubstantial extract, so ODbL's
 * share-alike does not reach this repository. The attribution is owed either
 * way, and is repeated in the root NOTICE.
 *
 * Two rules when editing:
 *
 *   - Read the coordinate off a map, don't estimate it. The original
 *     `Ayeduase Gate` sat about 330 m from the actual gate, which is far enough
 *     that pins at the gate were named after something else entirely.
 *   - Keep entries more than ~150 m apart. Inside `LANDMARK_HIT_KM` two
 *     landmarks compete for the same pin and the winner is whichever happens to
 *     be a few metres nearer, so "Africa Hall" and "Africa Hall Market" is a
 *     coin toss rather than a choice.
