 * The proximity rules that gate the two ends of a trip.

 * A phase can only be closed from the place it happens at: the business can
 * confirm a pickup once the courier is at their counter, and the courier can
 * confirm a delivery once they are at the customer's door. Both sides of the
 * app need the same numbers — the screen decides when to offer the button, the
 * API decides whether to honour it — so they live here rather than twice. A
 * client radius looser than the server's shows a button that then fails; a
 * tighter one hides a button the server would have accepted.

 * a doorway, whereas hostel blocks are addressed by their gate and delivery may

 *
 * Both now sit at or below the error on a typical phone GPS fix, which is the
 * risk to watch: someone genuinely standing at the door can still read as out
 * of range, and `LOCATION_FRESHNESS_MS` will not save them because the position
 * is recent and simply wrong. If either side reports the confirm button
