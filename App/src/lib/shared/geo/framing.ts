/**
 * Keeping more than one thing in view.
 *
 * A delivery has two parties and the map has one camera, so the question the
 * tracking screens actually ask is "are they both still on screen?" — not
 * "where is the rider?". Locking the camera onto one of them guarantees the
 * other is off it: at zoom 16 the viewport is roughly 500 m, and a rider on
 * their way to a counter is routinely a couple of kilometres out.
 *
 * The maths lives here, apart from the Maps SDK, because it is the part worth
 * testing and the SDK cannot be loaded in a test. `MapBackdrop` owns the
 * camera; this module only answers questions about points and boxes.
