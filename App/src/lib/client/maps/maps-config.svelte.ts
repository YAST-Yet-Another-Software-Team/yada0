 * has to cross to the client. It is protected by an HTTP-referrer restriction
 * and a quota cap in Google Cloud, not by secrecy.
 *
 * Delivered through context rather than `import.meta.env` for two reasons: the
 * value is read at runtime, so rotating the key needs a restart instead of a
 * rebuild; and, as `$auth/session.svelte` documents for the same pattern, a
 * module-level value would be shared by every in-flight SSR request.
