 * One send per address per minute, for the two endpoints a stranger can aim at

 *
 * Better Auth ships exactly this rule — 3 per 60s on `/send-verification-email`
 * and `/request-password-reset` — but it is enforced in the HTTP router's
 * `onRequest`, and every call this app makes goes through `auth.api.*` in
 * process. Those never touch the router, so the built-in limiter never sees
 * them. It still covers anyone hitting the endpoints directly; this covers the
 * form actions.
 *
 * Best-effort by construction: on Workers the cache lives in an isolate, and
 * there may be several. It raises the cost of using YADA as a mailbomb without
 * pretending to be a distributed rate limiter — the real ceiling is the
 * provider's daily quota.
