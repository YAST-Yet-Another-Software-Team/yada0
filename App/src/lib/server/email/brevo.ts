 * records into and domain authentication is impossible. Brevo will verify a
 * single sender *address* — it emails you a link, you click it — and gives 300
 * sends a day on the free tier indefinitely.
 *
 * Deliberately not the `@getbrevo/brevo` SDK: it is built on axios, which
 * needs Node's http stack and does not run on workerd.
