 *     holds no session and can obtain none.
 *   - `email` and `phone_number` — the contact details, which is the part of
 *     this a person actually means by "delete my data". Both are unique, so
 *     clearing them also frees the address to register again later.
 *   - the profile photo, and a courier's live position and availability, so
