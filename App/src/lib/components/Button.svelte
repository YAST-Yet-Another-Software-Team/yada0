   * A single emphasis ladder, loudest first:
   *
   *   primary / secondary   filled brand — the one thing to do on the screen
   *   outline               red border, no fill — anything that isn't that,
   *                         but still needs to look like a button: alternate
   *                         routes, and destructive actions alike
   *   neutral               bare ink — back, view, sign out, decline; anything
   *                         that shouldn't compete with the action beside it
   *
   * Tone is not encoded here. In a red-primary brand every cautionary treatment
   * lands on the same ramp as the brand itself, so a red-bordered "Cancel" and
   * a red-bordered "Open tracking" would differ by nothing a user could name.
   * The label carries the meaning; the variant only sets how loud it is. Where
   * a destructive action needs more than a label to be safe, the guard belongs
   * in the flow — a confirm step — not in the button's colour.
