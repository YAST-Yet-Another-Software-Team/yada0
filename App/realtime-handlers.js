/**
 * Socket.IO connection handling. Development only.
 *
 * The single entry point is `vite-plugin-socket-io.ts`, which attaches a socket
 * server to the Vite dev server. There is no production counterpart: Cloudflare
 * Workers is the only deployment target and has no always-on process for a
 * socket server to live in, so `REALTIME_ENABLED` is `false` there and the
 * business tracking screen falls back to polling `GET /api/trips`. This exists
 * so that fallback is not the *only* thing anyone ever exercises — live fixes
 * are the behaviour the DO-based replacement is meant to restore, and it helps
 * to be able to see them working.
 *
 * Sockets carry the browser's cookies but never pass through SvelteKit's `handle`
 * hook, so none of the app's route guards apply to them. Authorization here works
 * by asking the app's own HTTP API: Better Auth stays the single source of truth
 * for sessions, and trip membership reuses the participant check that
 * `GET /api/trips` already enforces.
 *
 * Plain JS with no SvelteKit imports: it is loaded from the Vite *config*, which
 * is evaluated before the `$lib` / `$env` aliases exist.
 */

/**
 * The runtime's own `fetch`, taken once at import.
 *
 * In dev, SvelteKit swaps `globalThis.fetch` for a wrapper for the duration of
 * every SSR render, to catch components that fetch while rendering. The calls
 * below are not that: they are socket handshakes and room joins, which happen
 * on their own schedule and only *coincide* with a render — but because the
 * wrapper is installed on a global, a handshake landing inside that window was
 * enough to print "Avoid calling `fetch` eagerly during server-side rendering"
 * against code that does nothing of the sort. This module is imported at start-up, long before any render can patch anything, so the
 * reference captured here is the real one.
